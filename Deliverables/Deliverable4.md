## 1. Introduction
Gaming Workout Hub is an exercise website that allows gamers to exercise while gaming, prioritizing customizability and tracking features based on the user.

You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:
Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests. 
Grading criteria (3 points): You should have an adequate number of automated tests. They should be well-written to exercise the main components of your system, covering the relevant inputs.

## Technology  
* HTML/CSS – Building & styling  
* JavaScript – Functionality  
* Discord – Communication  
* GitHub – Tracking & managing  
List the adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for choosing them.

Grading criteria (1 point): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## Deployment
Provide a link for the system in production and describe how you are deploying your system. 

Some alternatives for deploying your system in the cloud:

AWS. AWS Educate offers free credits for students. See the tutorial at https://docker-curriculum.com/ on how to create a container and deploy it on AWS. ]
Digital Ocean or Azzure. As part of the GitHub Education benefits, as a student, you can get $100 at Digital Ocean and $100 at Microsoft Azzure cloud computing platforms (see more details at https://education.github.com/students)Links to an external site..
Oracle Cloud. Oracle offers a free tier in its cloud environment that should be more than enough for your needs.
Firebase. Firebase can be a good choice if you are building a mobile phone app.
Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be graded based on the adequate use of the technology and its adequate description.
