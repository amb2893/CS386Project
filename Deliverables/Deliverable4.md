# Implementation 1
## 1. Introduction
Gaming Workout Hub is an exercise website that allows gamers to exercise while gaming, prioritizing customizability and tracking features based on the user. This website will make exercising at home fun and easy by letting gamers play games and get alarms of when to exercise and or check off a list of exercises they can customize. The gamer will be able to customize exactly what they want for their workout, allowing for a flexible schedule that caters to the gamers needs and wants. https://github.com/amb2893/CS386Project

## Tests
**Test Framework:** pytest - checks through HTML file to check everything is created  
  
**Example test case:** The following is an automated test that parses through an HTML file, looks for associated class variables, and makes sure that all classes are available and exist. If everything exists and is within the HTML file, it will return a success.  
  
**GitHub Automated Test File:** [GitHub](https://github.com/amb2893/CS386Project/blob/testHTML/PyTests/test_html.py)  

The test should run as follows:  
1. Loads HTML content from file (also checks to see if file exists)
2. Tests if the title is correct
3. Tests if the header exists
4. Tests if questions exists
5. Tests if all button classes exist
6. Test if you can submit
7. Sees if stylesheet is implemented correctly
8. Checks if there is a script file
9. Exits

You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:
Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests. 
Grading criteria (3 points): You should have an adequate number of automated tests. They should be well-written to exercise the main components of your system, covering the relevant inputs.

## UX Design
Before we started building the website we all discussed and came up with a color theme for our website and as the website was built more and more we set some standardized colors which we would use for each section of the website. We wanted a dark-themed website with purple as the primary accent, so most of our website is black to dark grey, with most of the functional parts of the website being a dark purple color.

## Lessons Learned
For our team's first release, we learned that we need to communicate better with everyone in the group. Most of our conversations are usually just two people talking with one another, but we need to make it about everyone. These incidents made us not understand some pieces of code and made it longer for the issues to be resolved. As of now the problems have now been fixed and communication has improved.
