## Description
Gaming Workout Hub is an exercise website that allows gamers to exercise while gaming, prioritizing customizability and tracking features based on the user. This website will make exercising at home fun and easy by letting gamers play games and get alarms of when to exercise and or check off a list of exercises they can customize. The gamer will be able to customize exactly what they want for their workout, allowing for a flexible schedule that caters to the gamers needs and wants.


## Verification
Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the product. 

For this deliverable, show an example of a unit test that uses mock objects to isolate the class from the rest of the system. 

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution. 
Grading criteria (5 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate use of Mock objects, and a print screen showing successful test execution.

## Acceptance Test
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located.
An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature.
A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution. 
Grading criteria (7 points): adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests, quality of the tests, adequate example of an acceptance test, print screen/video showing successful tests execution.

## Validation
At the beginning of the semester, you talked to the clients/potential users to understand their needs. Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable the following information:

Script: The script should have the tasks that you gave to the user, what data you collected, and the questions you asked. In particular, do not forget to add questions about the users’ general impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?) or closed questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? On the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at the inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script. Design a script to check if you are achieving your initial goals and if the features are implemented in a satisfactory way. 

Results: Conduct the user evaluation with at least 3 users. Report the data that you collected.
