This automated testing file contains eight tests in total. For the first few tests, it checks each individual page and makes sure there are no errors in each page. Then checks to see if our login page works, by acting as a user that wants to register, successfully registers information, then trys to login with that information. If successfully, they will be redirected to the main page. 

**First Test**:
1. Loads start page
2. Checks to see if successfully loaded

## Acceptance Test
For the acceptance tests, we used Selenium to test the user interface, specifically with Google Chrome and the Chrome webdriver.  
In our instance, we decided to use Python but had some difficulties using pip and installing Selenium on a Mac, so we had to create our own virtual environment to install Selenium and run the Python scripts to work with the Chrome web driver.  

We specifically chose to test the workouts and body test pages because they utilize user interaction the most.  

For the workouts page, we wanted to ensure that both implementations of the workouts would be generated correctly. As shown in the screenshots below, we created some simple functions to quickly go through the workout selection and confirm the choice, while also ensuring that the correct pages are being shown.. Selenium waits for the correct element of the page to show up, and then checks the header to ensure the correct details are being shown. After it iterates through the selection and confirmation questions, it first tests the interval-based workouts. For simplicity, it puts 3 seconds into the timer and then checks that a workout is generated by looking for "Your workout is:", ensuring that a workout has been generated after the interval. Similarly, it checks the round-based workouts by reloading the page and goes through the same selection and confirmation questions, inputs a 10, and then checks that a workout is generated.

The body test is much simpler. Selenium first gathers all of the buttons that are shown to the user, and then selects at least one option for each question, and then clicks submit. After this, it checks that there are exactly 3 daily workout recommendations based on the user's answers. Immediately after, Selenium refreshes the page to check for the correct behavior if there is not a selection for each question. It selects an option for the first few questions and then hits submit. Selenium then checks that an alert has popped up and the recommendations have not been generated, ensuring the correct logic of the website.

There is very simple output from Selenium after each successful test, but the assertions in the code would prevent these messages from being shown if they did not pass the tests.
