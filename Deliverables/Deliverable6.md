## Lesson Learned
Our team learned the importance of communication while working on a large scale coding project. We learned how valuable having a clear plan and deadlines are, and how following them may be difficult but is better in the long run. If we were to start this release again we would definetely make more solid plans and goals for each person and make sure everyone meets the deadlines.
