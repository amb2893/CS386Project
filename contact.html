            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>This project aims to aid casual gamers with fitness. The base idea for this project is to create a website that will help
                these gamers exercise by guiding them through at-home exercises. These exercises will be generated on the website and will
                give the users two different options to choose how these workouts will be generated; the user will be asked if they want to
                exercise after a certain interval of time, or they can also choose to input their stats from the game they are playing which
                will them generate the workout based off of those stats. This will help boost motivation to exercise, potentially creating
                a long-term improvement in their personal health.</p>
            <h2><br>Proposition</h2>
            <p>We want to be the website that helps gamers find the motivation to exercise. There is often downtime during games, either 
                during matchmaking or there is a point where progression slows down to a crawl, we want to utilize these times to encourage 
                fitness and provide the tools to accomplish personal fitness goals.</p>
