# Software Inception Report  

## 1. Introduction 

This project aims to aid casual gamers with fitness. The base idea for this project is to create a website that will help these gamers exercise by guiding them through at-home exercises. These exercises will be generated on the website and will give the users two different options to choose how these workouts will be generated; the user will be asked if they want to exercise after a certain interval of time, or they can also choose to input their stats from the game they are playing which will them generate the workout based off of those stats. This will help boost motivation to exercise, potentially creating a long-term improvement in their personal health.
