        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          This project aims to aid casual gamers with fitness. The base idea for
          this project is to create a website that will help these gamers
          exercise by guiding them through at-home exercises. These exercises
          will be generated on the website and will give the users two different
          options to choose how these workouts will be generated; the user will
          be asked if they want to exercise after a certain interval of time, or
          they can also choose to input their stats from the game they are
          playing which will them generate the workout based off of those stats.
          This will help boost motivation to exercise, potentially creating a
          long-term improvement in their personal health.

        <h2><br />Proposition</h2>
        <p>
          We want to be the website that helps gamers find the motivation to
          exercise. There is often downtime during games, either during
          matchmaking or there is a point where progression slows down to a
          crawl, we want to utilize these times to encourage fitness and provide
          the tools to accomplish personal fitness goals.
